## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyllis/data621-final-project/master/data/ucdp-prio-acd-181.csv'
war<- read.csv(url)
url2 <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyllis/data621-final-project/master/data/a.csv'
data <- read.csv(url2)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
filter_war <- war%>%
select(location,year) %>%
group_by(location,year) %>%
summarize(war_count = n()) 

```
```{r}

filter_war$location <- as.character(filter_war$location)
data$Country <- as.character(data$Country)
joined <- left_join(data, filter_war , by= c('Country' = 'location', 'Year' = 'year'))

```


```{r}
joined<-joined%>%
mutate(in_war = ifelse(is.na(war_count),FALSE,TRUE))

```
```{r}
write.csv(joined, 'joined.csv')
```
